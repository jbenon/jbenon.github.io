# Hi! I'm Juliette BÃ©non.

I am a PhD candidate in cognitive neuroscience at the [Paris Brain Institute](https://parisbraininstitute.org/), supervised by [Jean Daunizeau](https://sites.google.com/site/jeandaunizeauswebsite) in the [Motivation Brain Behavior team](https://sites.google.com/site/motivationbrainbehavior).

I study the mechanisms of goal-directed behavior, through models of computational and neuro-computational processes involved in value-based decision making.

My [first paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-024-00071-y) focuses on the optimal effort allocation policy for value synthesis, building on the idea that investing mental effort or resources in a decision increases one's confidence in the final choice.

I also use recurrent neural networks to identify potential biological constraints on the neural code of the orbitofrontal cortex that might induce irrational decisions.
